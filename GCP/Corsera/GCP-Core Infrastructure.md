### cloud computing: 
- Customers can scale their resource use up and down 
- Computing resources available on-demand and self-service 
- Customers pay only for what they use or reserve 
- Resources are available from anywhere over the network 

- Providers are NOT dedicating physical resources to each customer 

### Choose a fundamental characteristic of devices in a virtualized data center. 
- They are manageable separately from the underlying hardware. 

### Paas
### Platform as a Service 
- let you bind your application code to libraries that give access to the infrastructure your application needs 

### Infrastructure as a Service
- provides raw compute, storage, and network, organized in ways that are familiar from physical data centers 

### What kind of customer benefits most from billing by the second for cloud resources such as virtual machines?
- Customers who create and run many virtual machines 

### Services and APIs are enabled on a per project basis.

### Choose a fundamental characteristic of devices in a virtualized data center.
- They are manageable separately from the underlying hardware. 
- They use less resources than devices in a physical data center. 
- They are more secure. 
- They are available from anywhere on the Internet.
