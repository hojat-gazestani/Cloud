### cloud computing
- Customers can scale their resource use up and down 
- Computing resources available on-demand and self-service 
- Customers pay only for what they use or reserve 
- Resources are available from anywhere over the network 

- Providers are NOT dedicating physical resources to each customer 

### fundamental characteristic of devices 
* Choose a fundamental characteristic of devices in a virtualized data center. 
* They are manageable separately from the underlying hardware. 

### PaaS
* Platform as a Service 
* let you bind your application code to libraries that give access to the infrastructure your application needs 

### IaaS
* Infrastructure as a Service
* provides raw compute, storage, and network, organized in ways that are familiar from physical data centers 

### qus1
* What kind of customer benefits most from billing by the second for cloud resources such as virtual machines?
  * Customers who create and run many virtual machines 

### qus2
* Services and APIs are enabled on a per project basis.

### qus3
* Choose a fundamental characteristic of devices in a virtualized data center.
  * They are manageable separately from the underlying hardware. 
  * They use less resources than devices in a physical data center. 
  * They are more secure. 
  * They are available from anywhere on the Internet.
